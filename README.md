# MongoDB and Mongoose with Next.js

This example shows how you can use a MongoDB database to support your Next.js application.

**Pet** is an application that allows users to add their pets' information (e.g., name, owner's name, diet, age, dislikes, likes, and photo). They can also delete it or edit it anytime.
```

## Configuration

### Step 1. Get the connection string of your MongoDB server

In the case of MongoDB Atlas, it should be a string like this:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@my-project-abc123.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

For more details, follow this [MongoDB Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/drivers/) on how to connect to MongoDB.

### Step 2. Set up environment variables

Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:

- `MONGODB_URI` should be the MongoDB connection string you got from step 1.

### Step 3. Run Next.js in development mode

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! 

## Deploy on Vercel
